Java read video frame by frame. Java Media Framework project for reading video frame by frame.
The JMF-source is obtained from http://ohmydear.tistory.com/31 and can only be used for educational purposes.
Classes not available as source within the JMF-source are included in lib directory.
I took the classes from cross-platform jmf 2.1.1e-version.
Also includes jffmpeg-source http://jffmpeg.sourceforge.net/ to decode a few more codecs.
The program just reads through a video file and displays the frames.

Compilation:
ant (see compileMinimal.bat and build.xml to get started)

Execution:
java -cp "build/java;libMinimal" ui.JavaVideoAnalysis

Use:
Select video file
Click JavaVideoAnalysis to run through the video

Result save Path does nothing.
